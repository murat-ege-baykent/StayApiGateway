# StayApiGateway

There is not any particular assumption. However, I've encountered some problems that made me work a long time on them such as:
- POST method does not work on browsers, so I used Postman in order to demstrate the method
- Dockerized application does not work for some reason, I will look into it and change some of the files if necessary (if I can come up with a solution. If not, the project will only be working on localhost.).

I also tried working on the second task (RabbitMQ), but since I had already used too much time trying to figure out the solutoins to the problems I had, I figured thta I could not complete it in enough time.
